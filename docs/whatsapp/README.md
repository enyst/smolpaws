# WhatsApp Message Relay bridge

`apps/whatsapp` is the standalone WhatsApp bridge for SmolPaws' durable Message Relay. It is the
primary channel between the cat and its human, rebuilt in the shape `apps/slack` proved (bead
`smolpaws-kxa`, epic `smolpaws-zlo`): its own process, the shared Message Relay, the TypeScript
OpenHands agent-server on `:8790`, no `/turns`.

The legacy root process (`src/index.ts`, `npm start`) remains reference and rollback code. Normal
operation uses the standalone bridge. Run only one WhatsApp bridge for a given account.

## Deployment status

Since the verified September 17 promotion, `com.smolpaws.bridge.whatsapp` uses the shared product host
`com.smolpaws.relay-server` on `:8790`, retaining the conversations and scheduled work from the canary.
The old canary services on `:8791` and legacy `com.smolpaws` remain disabled. See the
[dated promotion record](READINESS.md#september-17-production-promotion) for preservation counts and
startup evidence; it does not claim a new user-confirmed reply after the move.

Current TypeScript conversations live in `~/.smolpaws/conversations/<uuid>/events/`. The older Main
transcripts remain separately at `~/.openhands/conversations/main-*/events.jsonl`. The WhatsApp auth
and ledger remain under `~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/`; promotion does not recreate the device link or Main
conversation. Normal relay/scheduler state is under `~/.smolpaws/coordinator/`.

Before starting on an existing WhatsApp account, follow [Readiness and cutover gates](READINESS.md).
The bridge imports the actual legacy `data/router_state.json` once into its shared message-identity journal.
A fresh relay database alone does not isolate reused server conversations. The setup below describes
configuration; follow the dated migration and rollback procedure when transferring an existing account.

## Flow

```text
WhatsApp (Baileys socket)
  -> ledger: ~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/messages.db (chats, messages, media, cursors)
     cursors are the ledger's own ingestion sequence (`messages.seq`), never WhatsApp's one-second timestamps,
     so two messages in the same second or a late offline-sync message are never skipped
  -> poll every 2s, one batch per registered chat, debounced
  -> WhatsAppBridge.pollChat: scope + trigger policy, <messages> transcript
  -> RelayRuntime.accept()             durable intake (~/.smolpaws/coordinator/whatsapp-relay-v1.db)
  -> TypeScript OpenHands agent-server (:8790), one conversation per chat lane
  -> agent EventLog
  -> syncDeliveryOutbox()              send_message actions + terminal response
  -> DeliveryDispatcher -> WhatsAppDeliveryTarget -> sock.sendMessage
```

Identity:

- lane: `whatsapp:{account}:{chat_jid}`, one agent-server conversation per registered chat;
- conversation id: the existing relay binding is authoritative; a new lane defaults to a deterministic id derived from its key (legacy `data/sessions.json` ids are never reused);
- intake source key: `whatsapp:{account}:{newest WhatsApp message id in the batch}`;
- delivery source key: `{agent event id}:{lane}`.

Outbound text is prefixed `smolpaws: ` exactly as before, because the human shares the account and the
ledger recognizes the cat's own messages by that prefix.

## What moved where

| Legacy (`src/`) | Bridge (`apps/whatsapp/src/`) |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` connect/reconnect/QR exit | `adapter.ts` `WhatsAppBridge.connect()` |
| `index.ts` `messages.upsert` + media download | `adapter.ts` `ingest()` |
| `startMessageLoop` + `message-loop.ts` | `adapter.ts` `pollOnce()` / `pollChat()` (per-chat progress; durable local intake and bounded HTTP requests) |
| `processMessage` transcript + images/docs | `handler.ts` `buildPrompt()` |
| `control-scope.ts` / `config.ts` trigger | `handler.ts` `shouldRespond()` + `config.ts` |
| `db.ts` chats/messages | `ledger.ts` (same schema, plus `relay_state` cursors) |
| `data/router_state.json` | One-time import into the shared message-identity progress journal in `messages.db` |
| `data/registered_groups.json` | `~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/registered_groups.json` (legacy path still read) |
| `sendMessage` + `whatsapp-jid.ts` rewrite | `deliveryTarget.ts` + `adapter.ts` `sendText()` |
| `whatsapp-auth.ts` | `auth.ts` (QR or pairing code) |
| `task-scheduler.ts` | Shared `src/coordinator/taskScheduler.ts`; see "Scheduler, media and rollback" below |
| voice outbox drain | `voiceOutbox.ts` imports the established producer into durable media delivery |

Each chat's agent conversation works in `groups/<scope>` under the checkout, as before. The
SmolPaws product server loads identity and private memory from its [context configuration](../context-files.md).
Select private memory explicitly for each authorized scope (for example `whatsapp:main` or
`whatsapp:openhands`). The full selected files are always-on SDK context, captured once beside each
conversation. No read-before-answer tool step or larger launch-suffix limit is needed.

Choose each chat's LLM profile in the shared [model configuration](../models.md), using scope keys
such as `whatsapp:main`. A changed selection applies to the existing conversation at a safe boundary;
the agent's `switch_llm` tool uses that same activation path. The bridge keeps no separate profile map.

## Errors and follow-up messages

The bridge also sends `smolpaws: 🐾 I'm up.` to every registered chat after startup. It does not
repeat that notice on ordinary socket reconnects or invoke the LLM. Set
`SMOLPAWS_WHATSAPP_STARTUP_PING=0` only when intentionally suppressing these notices, for example
during a silent test. See [shared startup notice behavior](../bridges.md#startup-notices).

A conversation-level error produces a short WhatsApp notice. Step-limit notices identify the limit;
other errors use a generic message without exposing raw provider details. Send a follow-up prompt to
continue the same conversation with its saved context and a fresh run allowance. The normal limit is
500 steps per run. See [conversation failure delivery](../bridges.md#conversation-failures-and-continuation)
for the shared outbox and configuration rules.

## Setup

### 1. Dependencies

```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix packages/openhands-agent-server
npm ci --prefix apps/whatsapp
```

### 2. Link the device

WhatsApp links a "device" to your phone's account. Credentials go to
`~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/auth/` and stay valid for weeks; the bridge refuses to pair inline and exits
with a macOS notification when a new link is needed.

QR code:

```bash
npm run whatsapp:auth
```

Pairing code (no camera needed; use the phone number of the WhatsApp account, international format):

```bash
npm run whatsapp:auth -- --phone +15551234567
```

Then on the phone: Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device → scan, or "Link with phone number
instead" and type the code. To re-link, delete `~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/auth/` and run again.

An existing link from the legacy root process is reused as-is; nothing to redo.

### 3. Register chats

The bridge selects one registration file at startup, in this order:

1. `SMOLPAWS_WHATSAPP_REGISTERED_GROUPS`, when set;
2. `<SMOLPAWS_HOME_DIR>/whatsapp/registered_groups.json`, when present (`SMOLPAWS_HOME_DIR` defaults to `~/.smolpaws`);
3. the legacy checkout's `data/registered_groups.json`, when present.

These files are **not merged**. An explicit canary file replaces the normal list for that process;
editing a fallback file does not change the running canary's chats. If no file exists, the bridge
starts with no registered chats. Each key is a WhatsApp chat JID:

```json
{
  "1234567890@s.whatsapp.net": { "name": "Engel", "folder": "main", "trigger": "@smolpaws", "added_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" },
  "120363012345678@g.us":     { "name": "Team",  "folder": "team", "trigger": "@smolpaws", "added_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z", "triggerFree": false }
}
```

Add another entry to the selected file to enable another chat; preserve its existing `folder` when
migrating a legacy group. `folder` selects the scope and `groups/<folder>` workspace. Only `main` is
the control scope. `triggerFree: true` lets another group answer ordinary text without granting
control-scope permissions. Otherwise, messages need an `@<ASSISTANT_NAME>` mention (normally
`@smolpaws`). The stored `trigger` field is retained for legacy compatibility; the current matcher
uses `ASSISTANT_NAME`, not a separate trigger per entry.

The selected file is re-read when its modification time changes, during ingestion and the two-second
poll loop. Adding a chat or changing `triggerFree` applies to subsequent human-message handling
without a restart. Changing the environment variable to select a different file requires restarting
the process. This reload does not recreate existing conversations: workspace/context and the server's
default profile are resolved when a conversation is first created. There is no per-chat model field.

Registration is checked before message content is stored. An excluded chat updates chat metadata only;
its new text/media is not saved for later recovery. A registered but unmentioned message is retained
as context for a later addressed message. Enabling a chat does not recover messages dropped while it
was excluded, and any already-pending ledger rows should be accounted for before expanding a canary.

### 4. Environment

`~/.smolpaws/.env` (loaded by every launcher):

```bash
SMOLPAWS_RELAY_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790     # default
SMOLPAWS_RELAY_SERVER_API_KEY=...                   # only if the server enforces X-Session-API-Key
ASSISTANT_NAME=smolpaws                             # default
SMOLPAWS_WHATSAPP_REGISTERED_GROUPS=/absolute/path/to/registered_groups.json  # optional override
```

The agent-server needs an active LLM profile and credential in its own state/keychain; legacy
`LLM_PROFILE_ID` does not select it. WhatsApp uses `groups/<folder>` for each chat's workspace,
overriding the shared bridge `SMOLPAWS_WORKING_DIR` default.

### 5. Run

Foreground (starts the agent-server on `:8790` if nothing healthy answers there, then the bridge):

```bash
npm run whatsapp:start
```

Supervised by launchd (macOS): install once, it survives reboots and restarts the bridge if it dies. The
agent-server it starts is left running for the other bridges.

```bash
npm run bridge:launchagent:install -- whatsapp
npm run bridge:launchagent:remove -- whatsapp
```

Logs: `~/.smolpaws/logs/bridge.whatsapp.launchagent.log` and
`~/.smolpaws/logs/openhands-agent-server-8790.log`.

Before the first start on a host that still runs the legacy root process, stop that LaunchAgent
(`npm run smolpaws:launchagent:remove`) or you get two clients on one account and duplicate replies.

## Verification (six-point canary)

A visible reply alone is not proof. Check every boundary:

1. the ledger has the inbound row: `sqlite3 ~/.smolpaws/whatsapp/messages.db "select id, chat_jid, content from messages order by timestamp desc limit 5"`;
2. an `intake` row reached `done` in `~/.smolpaws/coordinator/whatsapp-relay-v1.db`;
3. the agent-server has the conversation (`GET /api/conversations/{id}`) with the user event and a finished run;
4. `delivery` rows exist for the `send_message` action(s) and/or the terminal response;
5. each delivery is `done` with `send_attempted = 1` and a WhatsApp message id in `external_message_id`;
6. the reply appears in the right chat with the `smolpaws: ` prefix.

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.smolpaws/coordinator/whatsapp-relay-v1.db \
  "select kind, state, send_attempted, external_message_id, last_error from work order by updated_at desc limit 10"
```

`delivery_unknown` means the send may have landed; look at the chat before doing anything.

## Tests

```bash
npm run whatsapp:typecheck
npm run whatsapp:test
```

Inbound images use the SDK content shape, `{ "type": "image", "image_urls": ["data:..."] }`.
The SDK converts this to each provider's wire format. OpenAI-style `image_url` blocks are not
accepted by the agent-server; sending them fails intake and holds later messages in that lane.
The image contract test sends actual `buildPrompt()` output through the server's HTTP route
and verifies the saved text and image bytes, without calling a model.

The suite covers the trigger/scope policy, transcript building with images and documents, ledger
cursors, delivery chunking, and an end-to-end run through a fake Baileys socket, the real in-process
TypeScript agent-server with a deterministic test LLM, the durable relay store, and the delivery
target (both a mid-turn `send_message` and the final reply, exactly once, idempotent on replay).

## Scheduler, media and rollback

The [shared product host](../bridges.md#shared-scheduler-and-media-tools) binds the task tools to the
shared scheduler. Due tasks use the same relay intake as chat messages; all lifecycle commands return
real results. Outbound media and voice notes, including the existing `voice-outbox.jsonl` producer,
use a durable local spool and the normal delivery dispatcher.

Both updated host generations share message-identity progress. After draining and stopping the bridge,
run `npm run whatsapp:handoff -- legacy` before starting the updated legacy host. The command checks
in-flight work and exports scheduler changes; a simple service swap is insufficient. Always use the
latest production state, including changes since promotion; a frozen canary backup would lose that
progress and can replay effects. Follow the full
[readiness and rollback checklist](READINESS.md), including state isolation and the live test gates.
